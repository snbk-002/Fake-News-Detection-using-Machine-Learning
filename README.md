# üì∞ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and Gemini API

This project is a final-year academic implementation that aims to detect fake news articles by combining traditional Machine Learning algorithms with modern AI models like Gemini API and Large Language Models (LLMs). It also features a Flask-based web application for real-time inference and user interaction.

## üîç Introduction

With the rise of digital news consumption, the spread of misinformation and fake news has become a significant societal problem. This project presents a hybrid solution using:
- Machine Learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting),
- Gemini Flash API for real-time predictions, and
- NLP techniques for textual analysis.

The goal is to automatically classify whether a given news article is real or fake based on its content.

- Frontend: HTML, CSS (via Flask templates)
- Backend: Python, Flask
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- APIs: Gemini Flash API, News Data API
- Model Serialization: Pickle
